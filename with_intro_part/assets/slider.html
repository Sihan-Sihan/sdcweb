	   <!-- <h3>What is being studied</h3> -->

		<div class='story-text'>
		<p>The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between access to green space and self-rated mental health based on the 2011 census data obtained from the UK Data Service. Mapping and identifying areas with low access to green spaces will help inform future planning and management of the need to implement greening initiatives.</p>
		</div>


   <!-- <h3>Regression</h3> -->
      <div class='gap'>
		<div class='story-text'>
		<p>In order to answer the research question and study the relationship between accessibility to green spaces and self-assessed mental health, a linear regression analysis is conducted with the formula y = mx + c. Self-assessed mental health is taken as the independent variable (y), and the accessibility to green space is taken as the dependent variable (x). Since other socio-economic factors such as income, employment rate and crime rate may also have an effect on the self-assessed mental health, they were also considered into the regression in order to assess their impact. For the research question to stand true, there needs to be a significant relationship between the variables, which is determined by the r2 value.</p>

	  <!-- <h3>Histograms</h3> -->
	  <div class='gap'></div>
		<div class='story-text'>
		<p>A histogram is used in order to understand the variable distribution. To ensure that the distribution is considered normal, the skewness is required to be between 2 and -2. However, if the skewness of the dataset is beyond that range, it is necessary to conduct a log transformation. Since the accessibility to green spaces variable distribution was out of the range considered normal, it is necessary to log transform the variables for a more normal distribution and hence a more accurate regression.</p>

	  <!-- <h3>Scatter Plot</h3> -->
	  <div class='gap'>
		<div class='story-text'>
		<p>A scatter plot is used to display a relationship between the variables. This will help to identify any linear relationships and aid in visualizing the dataset.</p>

	  <!-- <h3>Correlation Matrix</h3> -->
	  <div class='gap'>
		<div class='story-text'>
		<p>In order to evaluate the relationship between the different variables such as income, employment rate, and crime rate, a correlation matrix is plotted showing the correlation between each two variables.</p>
		</div>
	  </div>

	  <!-- <h3>Regression Results</h3> -->
	  <div class='gap'>
		<div class='story-text'>
		<p>The results obtained from the regression prove that there is a correlation between self rated health and access to green space. Infact, access to green space appears to explain 53% of the variation in self-rated health. The P-values are less than the significance threshold of 0.05, which further proves that there is a genuine relationship.</p>
